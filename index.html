                        <p class="pt-5"> We have set a company-wide goal of building a
                            vacation property portfolio of one hundred properties
                            with the coveted Superhost status on Airbnb. A one
                            hundred property portfolio is a key component of
                            raising our HMC status with our regional and
                            international partners while serving as a platform to
                            leverage our success for future growth.</p>
                        <p>The Superhost status on Airbnb is reserved for the
                            best properties providing the best customer
                            experiences. To qualify for Superhost status our
                            overall portfolio must maintain a 4.8-star average
                            (which means 80% 5-star properties), 90% response
                            rate, and 1% cancellation rate.</p>
                        <p>Achieving a one hundred property portfolio with Superhost status is aligned with our
                            organization’s goal of being recognized as Hospitality Management's gold standard of
                            excellence and service innovation in the vacation and short-term rental markets we
                            serve.</p>
