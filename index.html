                            “A Dose of Amazing™” is the term we use to describe
                            how we make guest experiences special at Tangerine
                            Sunsets. It’s our unique way of delivering extraordinary
                            experiences to our guests based on our core values,
                            how we’d like to be treated, and sets us apart.

                        <p>
                            Each “dose of amazing” is created using the principle
                            of The Golden Rule and always contains 3 essential ingredients: It is design to delight,
                            be instantly familiar,and provide real comfort and joy.

                            question, “will this experience or proposed change delight our guests?” We only move
                            forward if the answer is “yes”. This is only possible when you obsessively build an
                            experience from the customer’s point of view.</p>

                            understand their needs and look around the corner to anticipate and innovate ways to
                            serve them. Whether looking for directions, things to do, how to operate the TV,

                        <p class="pt-5">We have set a company-wide goal of building a vacation property portfolio of one
                            hundred
                            properties with the coveted Superhost status on Airbnb. A one hundred property portfolio is
                            a key component of raising our HMC status with our regional and international partners while
                            serving as a platform to leverage our success for future growth.</p>
                        <p>The Superhost status on Airbnb is reserved for the best properties providing the best
                            customer experiences. To qualify for Superhost status our overall portfolio must maintain a
                            4.8-star average (which means 80% 5-star properties), 90% response rate, and 1% cancellation
                            rate.</p>
                        <p>a one hundred property portfolio with Superhost status is aligned with our
                            organization’s goal of being recognized as an iconic brand of excellence and HMC leader in
                            the vacation rental markets we serve.</p>
