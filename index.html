                            <strong>“A Dose of Amazing™ ”</strong> is the term we use to describe

                            Sunsets. It’s our unique way of delivering extraordinary
                            experiences to our guests based on our core values,
                            how we’d like to be treated, and sets us apart.

                            provide real comfort and joy.

                        <p>We delight our customers by anticipating their needs before they
                            can articulate them. This means we always have to think ahead and
                            see around the corner to provide the best solutions and avoid
                            problems that are not immediately obvious. If you stay ready, you
                            don’t have to get ready.</p>

                        <p class="pt-5"> We have set a company-wide goal of building a
                            vacation property portfolio of one hundred properties
                            with the coveted Superhost status on Airbnb. A one
                            hundred property portfolio is a key component of
                            raising our HMC status with our regional and
                            international partners while serving as a platform to
                            leverage our success for future growth.</p>
                        <p>The Superhost status on Airbnb is reserved for the
                            best properties providing the best customer
                            experiences. To qualify for Superhost status our
                            overall portfolio must maintain a 4.8-star average
                            (which means 80% 5-star properties), 90% response
                            rate, and 1% cancellation rate.</p>
                        <p>Achieving a one hundred property portfolio with
                            Superhost status is aligned with our organization’s
                            goal of being recognized as an iconic brand of
                            excellence and HMC leader in the vacation rental
                            markets we serve. </p>
